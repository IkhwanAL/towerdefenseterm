# Tower Defense In Terminal

## What this project is all about

this project is try to create a simple game in terminal

## Motivation

Learn how does the game frame work, and try to create a game without game engine just using a simple library to render in terminal and probably learn something new along the way

## Learn

- Timing The Ticker Is Quite Difficult. Rendering Ticker, Tower Attack Speed Ticker, Enemy Flashing When Get Hit Ticker To Get Those Three Sync and not messed up one after another.

- Manage to Create Procedural generated road where each time run an app it will create new road randomize

- Manage to create tower random generated tower placement each time running an app

- Manage to use Fuzz Testing where it test random activity in specific function in this case i use fuzz testing in Procedural generated road to make sure to detect error early.

## Future Plan

- Create UI Interface
- Create Variant Of Enemy Unit
- Or Other -> i need time to think again
